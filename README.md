## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The piece leverages data to uncover the true economic consequences as a result of Florida's ambitious attempt to reopen the state and their economy, and how other states should think about their own reopening plans. The power of data is the ability to silence all the political noise that is confusing this conversation, and help us understand what is actually happening.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

All code and analysis can be found in the florida_cases.ipynb notebook.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of my analysis can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@nathanfreystaetter/how-to-reopen-an-economy-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-e93923163e03).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Thanks to the Florida Department of Health for providing very clean row-level data on case and death volumes. Feel free to share your thoughts or ideas on how I can improve my analysis or presentation of my findings.
